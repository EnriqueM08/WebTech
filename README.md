******This is a compilation of the various Labs created in my Web Technologies Class******

**Lab 3**
This lab is a basic HTML webpage with links to info about myself as well as a contact page that is currently not working.

**Lab 4**
Updated the previous lab to utilize an external CSS file for styling.

**Lab 5**
Updated the previous lab with further CSS styling.

**Lab 6**
This lab uses an external JavaScript file to create an object and alert or print to the screen info about the object in the origin HTML file.

**Lab 7**
This lab contains the files from lab 5, but this was hosted on an AWS server.

**Lab 8**
This lab utilizes AJAX to request from a JavaScript file to a PHP file and displays the typed-in first name and last name to the screen by altering the paragraph on the page.

**Lab 9**
This lab connects to MySQL using PHP and then grabs information from the database and displays that information on the page.

**Lab 10**
This lab contains two PHP files and an HTML file that calls one file with a POST call and passes the typed-in information from the form on the HTML page.
The PHP script then appends this information to the end of a file on the AWS instance. The second PHP script opens the file written to previously and then prints its information to the page.

**Lab 12**
This lab is a testing of cookies and will alert you if the given cookie is set or not and if it is set, it will alert you to the value stored in the cookie.
